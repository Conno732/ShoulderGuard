## Inspiration
Shoulder surfing, as the name implies, occurs when an attacker tries to look directly over someone's shoulder to obtain PIN, passwords, or other sensitive information. Shoulder surfing happens to a substantial amount of people even if it’s not for malicious purposes. A recent study found that 73% of survey respondents indicated they had seen someone else’s confidential PIN without them knowing. Due to its prevalence, particularly in public places, our team is motivated to create a chrome extension app to combat the problem.
## What it does
We create a chrome extension app that uses a facial recognition algorithm to determine whether there is another person looking over the screen during the moment when the user is entering their passwords. In a case when shoulder surfing is detected, the app automatically notifies the user via a popup window. Our app does not store any information from the user and only activate the laptop's camera when a password field is clicked.
